# KuzuhaScriptPHP+ (くずはすくりぷとPHP+)
An improved version of the PHP port of KuzuhaScript (くずはすくりぷと).
As of 2024/10/16, it only works with PHP8+
Last legacy PHP (from 4.1.0 to 7.4) version can be found here: [https://github.com/Heyuri/ksphp-plus/releases/tag/20240710](https://github.com/Heyuri/ksphp-plus/releases/tag/20240710)

This program is based on the 2005/04/01 modified version of KuzuhaScriptPHP (くずはすくりぷとPHP).

This program has originally been translated to English by [Anonymous-san at Strange World@Heyuri.net](https://dis.heyuri.net/bbs.php?c=08&m=tree&ff=202205.dat&s=3555) and several anonymous developers from Heyuri have contributed to it since.

## Installation process (for reference only)
1. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file
2. Open and configure conf.php
3. Upload the files to the server using an FTP client or similar (it's a good idea to create a dedicated directory so that it doesn't get mixed up with other files)
4. Set the permissions as described in readme.md
5. Open a web browser, access bbs.php, and set the administrator password
6. Open your local conf.php file, paste the admin password generated in step 6 to 'ADMINPOST' => 'here' on line 36, then upload the file using your FTP client to overwrite it
7. Open your web browser, go to bbs.php, and see if you can post
8. Access the URL where the log files (bbs.log, files inside log/, etc.) are located using a web browser, and check if you can see it (if you can see it, please hide it with .htaccess, etc.)

## Recommended permission settings
Incorrect permissions can cause problems and data leaks (such as a post's IP address or remote host), so please make sure that they are set correctly.

    |-- bbsadmin.php    644 (read-only)     Administration module
    |-- bbslog.php      644 (read-only)     Log viewer module

    |-- phpzip.inc.php  644 (read-only)     ZIP file creation library
```

If PHP runs as an Apache module, bbs.php will run as read-only, 
but if it runs as CGI, bbs.php needs to be set to 755 (executable).

### 2026/07/18
* gikoneko.php / gikonekoadd.php UI text is now localized through the
  standard `$MSG` mechanism (22 new keys added to language/*.txt)
* gikoneko.php: the fortune data file is now auto-created when missing,
  so `file()` no longer emits a raw PHP warning into the page output
* gikonekoadd.php: fixed a data-file path mismatch (`../cgi-bin/...`)
  that caused newly taught words to never reach gikoneko.php's fortune
  pool; both scripts now reference the same root-level data file
* ayashiibreaker.js updated to v0.4.0: Japanese lines are now
  line-broken by character count with kinsoku shori (禁則処理) rules,
  instead of relying on space-delimited word wrapping

### 2026/07/19
* bbs.php: the main board display (`getdispmessage()`) and the current-log
  branch of `msgsearchlist()` now stream the log file line-by-line
  (`Func::fgetline()`) instead of loading the whole file into memory via
  `file()`. Peak memory for a normal page view no longer scales with
  `LOGSAVE` / log file size (verified: ~131MB -> ~2MB peak on a
  102,300-line / ~58MB log; a simulated 100-concurrent-request traffic
  spike no longer triggers OOM kills, unlike the previous implementation)
* bbs.php: removed the long-commented-out YouTube embedding code
  (superseded by ytthumb.js since 2024/10/16)
* bbs.php / conf.php: whether "Gikoneko-to-issho" is shown when there are
  no unread posts is now configurable via `GIKONEKO_TOISSHO` (1=on,
  0=off, default 1); disabling it falls back to the previous plain
  "no unread posts" message
* install.php: added a text-input "add a new install destination" flow
  for folders not found by the nearby-scan (with path-traversal
  validation and a confirmation step before use)
* install.php: added Japanese/English UI language switching (default
  Japanese), including translated install-log messages
* install.php: added a safety guard rejecting installs targeting the
  filesystem root, overly shallow paths, or the install/ folder itself
* install.php: existing files are now moved to backup via `rename()`
  (atomic) instead of `copy()`, per-file backup/rename failures now skip
  just that file instead of aborting the whole run, a failed write of
  the new file automatically rolls back the moved-aside original, and
  failures are additionally recorded to
  `install/backup/install-errors-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` for later review

## ToDo:
* View posts by thread
* Setting for whether or not to use the mobile module
* Form does not appear on the new post screen
* Proper use of multi-byte functions and jcode
* Setting for UNDO expiration date
* Have uploader thumbnailing javascript to easily support other instances of Uploader softwares
* (Decided 2026-07-18, maintainer judgment call) Top-page post form
  intentionally does NOT show the "Post complete" confirmation screen
  (only follow-up/reply posts show it). Reviewed and kept as-is; not a
  bug.
* (Decided 2026-07-18, maintainer judgment call) `Cache-Control:
  no-store` will NOT be added to bbs.php. The occasional stale form
  content after posting then navigating back is accepted as a
  trade-off in favor of bfcache's faster "back" navigation.

## Known Bugs:
* Large number of \&nbsp; appearances when searching logs
